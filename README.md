# Merge Sort and Bubble Sort Implementation & Comparison

Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm. Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list. This code compares the execution time of Bubble Sort and Merge Sort on the same array of 1000 random integers. 

The time complexity of Merge Sort is O(nlongn), compared to Bubble Sort's O(n^2) time complexity.
